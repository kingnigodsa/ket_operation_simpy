# ket_operation_simpy_simulation
A symbolic framework for simulating pure and mixed quantum states, gates, measurements, and entanglement in Python with sympy.

---

## Features

- Symbolic manipulation of **pure states** and **mixed states**
- Built-in **quantum gates**: Pauli (X, Y, Z), Hadamard, CNOT, rotation gates
- **Measurement** and projection (including mixed-state measurements)
- **Tensor product** and **partial trace**
- **Fidelity** and **Schmidt decomposition**
- Exact **density matrix** representation from mixed states
- Protocol demos: **quantum teleportation**, **entanglement distillation**, and more

## Requirements

- Python â‰¥ 3.8
- [`sympy`](https://www.sympy.org/)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install sympy
